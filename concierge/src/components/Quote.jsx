        I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge your staff for their
        Courteous, Passionate and Professional behavior towards the residents of
        The William Oliver Building. I have personally experienced their service
        as a resident since 2016 plus the numerous resident compliments that the
        HOA Board has received. The Concierges have always gone above and beyond
        for the residents. Please convey the {"Board's"} gratitude to the
        concierges and for your leadership. Thank you.
